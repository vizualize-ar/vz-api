# Introduction 
This is the Reviews microservice. It's used by the business portal, consumer portal, and widgets to create, read, update, delete reviews for a business.

# Getting Started
## Installation process
Run `make_links.bat` to create the symlinks to the shared projects in each microservice directory. This is required because in the build pipeline, the shared repository is checked out in a folder called shared in the working directory of the microservice. The symlink mimics this folder hierarchy on your development machine.
